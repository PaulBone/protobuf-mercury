This directory contains a simple example of how to use protocol buffers in
Mercury:

    person.proto: defines a protocol for sending information about people.

    writeread_person.m: write a person message to a file and then read it
        in again.

To build the sample, first run make in the top-level directory and then
run make in this directory.

To run the sample do:

    ./writeread_person test

This will write a person to the file test and then read it back in again.
