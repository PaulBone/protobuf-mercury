To add a new test you need to do the following:

- Add the name of the test to the TESTS variable in Makefile.
- Add the following files to this directory, where <test> is the name of
  your test:
    - <test>.proto:     proto file for the test
    - <test>.inp:       input value as a Mercury term
    - <test>.type:      file containing the Mercury type name of the
                        message type to test
    - <test>.class:     file containing the C++ class name of the message type
                        to test
    - <test>.cppexp:    expected output of the C++ DebugString() method
- If the expected output of the Mercury reader is different from the input
  term (for example because of default values in the .proto file), the you can
  also add <test>.mexp.
